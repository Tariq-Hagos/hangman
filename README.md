## Description

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters one at a time. The aim of this project is to create a simple command-line version of the Hangman game in Python. This project demonstrates the use of Python programming concepts, including classes, functions, and user input processing.

### What I Learned

Throughout the development of this project, I learned the following:

- Creating a command-line game in Python.
- Using classes and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.
- Handling user input and validation.
- Implementing game logic, including word selection, checking guesses, and tracking player lives.

## Installation

To play the Hangman game on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tariq-Hagos/hangman.git
   
2. If mnltk module is not installed:
   ```bash
   pip install nltk

3. Run the game
    ```bash
    python milestone_5.py


## How to Play
You have a limited number of lives (5 by default) .<br>
Enter a letter one at a time to make a guess for the word.<br>
The game will inform if you guesses a letter correct and will reveal the position of the correctly guessed letters. <br>
If you run out of lives you lose the game. <br>
If you correctly guess all the letters you win the game. <br>
